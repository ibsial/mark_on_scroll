## ðŸ“œ Your Scroll moments go to script ðŸ“œ  

## Installation and setup
1. rename `config_example.ts` to `config.ts`, `example.privates.txt` to `privates.txt` and `env` to `.env`
2. paste your privates to `privates.txt`, `okx API data to '.env'` and setup a script you will use in `config.ts`  
3. install depencies `npm i`  
4. run script `npm run start`

## Scenarios
1. Mainnet bridge task
    - withdraw from exchange to L2s or Ethereum
    - bridge using [relay.link](https://relay.link/bridge/ethereum/) to Ethereum (if needed)
    - bridge to Scroll using [scroll bridge](https://scroll.io/bridge)

> Note that relay.link takes more fee the more ETH you bridge. Withdrawing to Ethereum may work better for you
